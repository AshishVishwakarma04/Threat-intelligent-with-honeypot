# Threat-intelligent-with-honeypot


<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Introduction:</strong></span>

<b>Threat intelligent with honeypot</b>,  
<ul>
  <li>cutting-edge system that
integrates with Blue Wireless, Twilio and StoryBlok to
provide real-time threat intelligence detection of
cyber attacks.</li>
  <li>Our system employs the use of honeypots, both
internal and external, to effectively detect and
respond to potential threats.</li>
  <li>The internal components of the system include the
ESP Node 32, which acts as a honeypot to lure in
potential attackers.</li>
<li>The external components include a virtual machine
honeypot that provides an added layer of defense.
  </li>

  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WHAT DO OUR PROJECT DO?</strong></span>
<ul>
	<li>When a hacker attacks the system, the first point of
contact will be the honeypot.</li>
	<li>This will trigger an alert that informs the system's owner
via SMS or WhatsApp message, providing them with
valuable information about the attack and allowing
them to take proactive measures to prevent further
damage.</li>

<ul>
	<li>VISION :</li>
	<li>Our vision is to create a secure and
connected world by providing real-
time threat intelligence through our
cutting-edge honeypot system,
HoneyNet.</li>

<h2>USE OF HONEYPOT</h2>
  <h3>INTERNAL HONEYPOT</h3>
 <p>[+]In the internal network, we recognize
the potential for intruders to penetrate
the network.<br>
    [+]To address this, we have implemented
an internal wifi honeypot that acts as a
normal access point and records IP
addresses and BSS IDs.<br>
    [+]This allows us to identify and block
unauthorized IP addresses, enhancing
the overall security of the internal
network and organization.
</p> 
<br>
<h3>INTERNAL HONEYPOT<h3>
  <p>[+]In the external network, organizations are constantly
facing cyberattacks on their network and web services.<br>
    [+]To identify and block these attackers, we have set up
an intentionally vulnerable honeypot.<br>
    [+]This honeypot allows hackers to attack it and records
all their IP addresses, port numbers, and the services
they use.<br>
    [+]With this information, we can effectively block the
attacker's IP address, ensuring that they cannot access
the real network and compromising the security of the
organization.</p>
